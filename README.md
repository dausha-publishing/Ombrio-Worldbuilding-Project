# Ombrio Worldbuilding Project

The **Ombrio Worldbuilding Project** (hereafter, OWP or Project) is an effort to develop a slipstream genre milieu via community. It was founded by Benjamin Wilson as a way to help flesh out the milieu. He saw this as a chance to encourage other writers to share a milieu. Delusions of grandeur assert that a project like this could yield a universe as rich as Star Wars, Star Trek and other cult-followed. All it lacks is content...and a cult.

See the [Ombrio Worldbuilding Project Call to Action](http://dausha.net/ombrio/world-building) page for more information.
